# Cyware Assignment
## DevOps

The project contains all the files as was asked in the assignment provided. 

- Q1: `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` and `Jenkinsfile` 
- Q2: For the first problem of Q2 the solution file is `Q2_i.py` and for the second problem, the solution is `Q2_ii.py`.
```
For running the scripts Q2_i.py and Q2_ii.py use command: python3 Q2_i.py and python3 Q2_ii.py 
```

## Question 1

- Created a docker image for a simple html app.
- Added self signed ssl certificate.
- Created a docker compose file to automatically build and run the application.
- Jenkinsfile which could be integrated with the github and can be configured to trigger build of docker image, unit testing and pushing of docker image to Dockerhub/ECR/ACR.

-------------------------
- I think with the inclusion of right set of unit tests for the application, we will be good to go for the first deployment in the production environment.


## Question 2

- Both the questions completed and tested with the sample csv file provided.
